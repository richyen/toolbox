# This property tells EFM which OS user owns the $PGDATA dir for the
# 'db.database'.  By default, the owner is either 'postgres' for PostgreSQL
# or 'enterprisedb' for EDB Postgres Advanced Server.  However, if you
# have configured your db to run as a different user, you will need to
# copy the /etc/sudoers.d/efm-XX conf file to grant the
# necessary permissions to your db owner.
#
# This username must have write permission to the 'db.data.dir'
# specified below.
db.service.owner=enterprisedb

# Specify the proper service name in order to use service commands rather
# than pg_ctl to start/stop/restart a database. For example, if this property
# is set, then 'service <name> restart' or 'systemctl restart <name>'
# (depending on OS version) will be used to restart the database rather than pg_ctl.
# This property is required if running the database as a service.
db.service.name=

# Specify the directory containing the pg_controldata/pg_ctl commands, for example:
# /usr/edb/as11/bin. Unless the db.service.name property is used, the pg_ctl
# command is used to start/stop/restart databases as needed after a
# failover or switchover. This property is required.
db.bin=/usr/edb/asver/bin

# For database version 12 and up, this is the directory where a standby.signal
# file will exist for a standby node. For previous versions, this is the
# location of the db recovery.conf file on the node. On a standby node,
# the trigger file location is read from the file in this directory.
# After a failover, the recovery.conf files on remaining standbys are changed
# to point to the new master db (a copy of the original is made first). On a
# master node, a recovery.conf file will be written during failover and
# promotion to ensure that the master node can not be restarted as the
# master database.
# This corresponds to database environment variable PGDATA and should be same
# as the output of query 'show data_directory;' on respective database.
db.data.dir=/var/lib/edb/asver/data

# Specify the location of database configuration files if they are
# not contained in the same location as the recovery.conf or standby.signal
# file. This is most likely the case for Debian installations. The location
# specified will be used as the -D value (the location of the data directory
# for the cluster) when calling pg_ctl to start or stop the database.
# If this property is blank, the db.data.dir location specified by the
# db.data.dir property will be used.
# This corresponds to the output of query 'show config_file;' on respective database.

# Use the jdbc.sslmode property to enable ssl for EFM connections. Setting
# this property to anything but 'disable' will force the agents to use
# 'ssl=true' for all JDBC database connections (to both local and remote
# databases). Valid values are:
#
# disable   - Do not use ssl for connections.
# verify-ca - EFM will perform CA verification before allowing the
#             certificate.
# require   - Verification will not be performed on the server certificate.
jdbc.sslmode=disable

# Email address(es) for notifications. The value of this property must
# be the same across all agents. Multiple email addresses must
# be separated by space. If using a notification script instead,
# this property can be left blank.
user.email=richard.yen@enterprisedb.com

# Use the from.email property to specify the from email address that
# will be used for email notifications. Use the %h placeholder to
# represent the name of the node host (e.g. example@%h). The
# placeholder will be replaced with the name of the host as returned
# by the hostname command.
# Leave blank to use the default, efm@localhost.

notification.level=INFO

# Absolute path to script run for user notifications.
#
# This is an optional user-supplied script that can be used for
# notifications instead of email. This is required if not using
# email notifications. Either/both can be used. The script will
# be passed two parameters: the message subject and the message body.
script.notification=

# This property specifies the ip address and port that jgroups
# will bind to on this node. The value is of the form <ip>:<port>.
# Note that the port specified here is used for communicating with
# other nodes, and is not the same as the admin.port below, used
# only to communicate with the local agent to send control signals.
# For example, <provide_your_ip_address_here>:7800
bind.address=

# This property controls the port binding of the administration server
# which is used for some commands (ie cluster-status). The default

admin.port=5431

# Specifies whether or not this is a witness node. Witness nodes
# do not have local databases running.
is.witness=false

# These properties apply to the connection(s) EFM uses to monitor
# the local database. Every 'local.period' seconds, a database check
# is made in a background thread. If the main monitoring thread does
# not see that any checks were successful in 'local.timeout' seconds,
# then the main thread makes a final check with a timeout value
# specified by the 'local.timeout.final' value. All values are in seconds.
# Whether EFM uses single or multiple connections for database checks
# is controlled by the 'db.reuse.connection.count' property.
local.period=10
local.timeout=60
local.timeout.final=10

# The value of this property must be the same across all agents.
node.timeout=50

# Shut down the database after a master agent detects that it has

# If specified, a 'script.db.failure' script is run after this attempt.
stop.failed.master=true

# Treat a master agent shutdown as a failure. This can be set to true
# to treat a master agent shutdown as a failure situation, e.g. during
# the shutdown of a node, accidental or otherwise. Caution should be

# promotion in the case of performing master database maintenance.
# Please see the user's guide for more information.
master.shutdown.as.failure=false

# This is the address of a well-known server that EFM can ping in an
# effort to determine network reachability issues.  It might be the IP
# address of a nameserver within your corporate firewall or another server
# that *should* always be reachable via a 'ping' command from each of the
# EFM nodes.
#
# There are many reasons why this node might not be considered reachable:
# firewalls might be blocking the request, ICMP might be filtered out,
# etc.
#
# Do not use the IP address of any node in the EFM cluster (master, standby,
# or witness) because this ping server is meant to provide an additional
# layer of information should the EFM nodes lose sight of each other.
#
# The installation default is Google's DNS server.
ping.server.ip=127.0.0.1

# This command will be used to test the reachability of certain nodes.
#
# Do not include an IP address or hostname on the end of this command - it
# will be added dynamically at runtime with the values contained in 'virtual.ip'

#
# Make sure this command returns reasonably quickly - test it from a shell

# faster to start the cluster when the initial set of hosts
# is already known.
auto.allow.hosts=true

# When set to true, EFM will not rewrite the .nodes file whenever new nodes
# join or leave the cluster. This can help starting a cluster in the cases
# where it is expected for member addresses to be mostly static, and combined
# with 'auto.allow.hosts' makes startup easier when learning Failover Manager.
stable.nodes.file=false

# This property controls how many times a database connection is reused
# before creating a new one. If set to zero, a new connection will be
# created every time an agent pings its local database.
db.reuse.connection.count=0

# Whether or not failover will happen automatically when the master
# fails. Set to false if you want to receive the failover notifications
# but not have EFM actually perform the failover steps.
# The value of this property must be the same across all agents.
auto.failover=false

# After a standby is promoted, Failover Manager will attempt to
# update the remaining standbys to use the new master. For database
# versions before 12, Failover Manager will back up recovery.conf.
# Then it will change the host parameter of the primary_conninfo entry
# in recovery.conf or postgresql.auto.conf, and restart the database. The
# restart command is contained in either the efm_db_functions or
# efm_root_functions file; default when not running db as an os
# service is: "pg_ctl restart -m fast -w -t <timeout> -D <directory>"
# where the timeout is the local.timeout property value and the
# directory is specified by db.data.dir. To turn off
# automatic reconfiguration, set this property to false.
auto.reconfigure=true

# A standby with this set to false will not be added to the failover
# priority list, and so will not be available for promotion. The
# property will be used whenever an agent starts as a standby or
# resumes as a standby after being idle. After startup/resume, the
# node can still be added or removed from the priority list with the
# 'efm set-priority' command. This property is required for all
# non-witness nodes.
promotable=true

# Use replay LSN value for tiebreaker when choosing a standby to promote
# before using failover priority. Set this property to true to consider
# replay location as more important than failover priority (as seen in
# cluster-status command) when choosing the "most ahead" standby to promote.
use.replay.tiebreaker=true

# During a switchover, recovery settings are copied from a standby
# to the original master. If the application.name property is set,
# Failover Manager will replace the application_name portion of the
# primary_conninfo entry with this property value before starting
# the original master database as a standby. If this property is
# not set, Failover Manager will remove the parameter value
# from primary_conninfo.
application.name=

# If the restore_command on a standby restores directly from the master node, use this property
# to have Failover Manager change the command when a new master is promoted.
#
# Use the %h placeholder to represent the address of the new master. During promotion
# it will be replaced with the address of the new master.
#
# If not specified, failover manager will not change the restore_command value, if any,
# on standby nodes.
#
# Example:
# restore.command=scp <db service owner>@%h:/var/lib/edb/as12/data/archive/%f %p
restore.command=

# Reduce num_sync when the number of synchronous standbys drops below the
# value required by the master database. If set to true, Failover Manager will
# reduce the number of standbys needed in the master's
# synchronous_standby_names property and reload the master configuration.
# Failover Manager will not reduce the number below 1, taking the master
# out of synchronous replication, unless the reconfigure.sync.master
# property is also set to true.
reconfigure.num.sync=false

# Take the master database out of synchronous replication mode when needed.
# If set to true, Failover Manager will clear the synchronous_standby_names
# configuration parameter on the master if the number of synchronous
# standbys drops below the required level for the master to accept writes.
# If set to false, Failover Manager will detect the situation but will only
# send a notification if the standby count drops below the required level.
#
# CAUTION: TAKING THE MASTER DATABASE OUT OF SYNCHRONOUS MODE MEANS THERE
# MAY ONLY BE ONE COPY OF DATA. DO NOT MAKE THIS CHANGE UNLESS YOU ARE SURE
# THIS IS OK.
reconfigure.sync.master=false

# Instead of setting specific standbys as being unavailable for
# promotion, this property can be used to set a minimum number
# of standbys that will not be promoted. Set to one, for example,
# promotion will not happen if it will drop the number of standbys
# below this value. This property must be the same on each node.
minimum.standbys=0

# Time in seconds between checks to see if a promoting database
# is out of recovery.
recovery.check.period=2

# Time in seconds to keep trying to connect to a database after a start
# or restart command returns successfully but the database is not
# ready to accept connections yet (a rare occurrence). This applies to
# standby databases that are restarted when being reconfigured for a new
# master, and to master databases that are stopped and started as
# standbys during a switchover.
#
# This retry mechanism is unrelated to the auto.resume.period parameter.
restart.connection.timeout=60

# Period in seconds for IDLE agents to try to resume monitoring after

# to not try to resume (in which case the 'efm resume <cluster>' command
# is used after bringing a database up).
auto.resume.period=0

# These properties specify the IP and prefix length that will be remapped during
# failover. If you do not use a VIP as part of your failover solution, leave
# the virtual.ip property blank to disable Failover Manager support for VIP processing
# (assigning, releasing, testing reachability, etc).
#
# If you specify a VIP, the interface and prefix are required.
#
# If specify a host name, it will be resolved to an IP address when acquiring or
# releasing the VIP. If the host name resolves to more than one IP address,
# there is no way to predict which address Failover Manager will use.
#
# By default, the virtual.ip and virtual.ip.prefix values must be the same
# across all agents. If you set virtual.ip.single to false, you can specify unique values
# for virtual.ip and virtual.ip.prefix on each node.

# or shut down through other means.
check.vip.before.promotion=true

# Absolute path to load balancer scripts
#
# The attach script is called when a node should be attached to the load
# balancer, for example after a promotion. The detach script is called
# when a node should be removed, for example when a database has failed
# or is about to be stopped. Use %h to represent the IP/hostname
# of the node that is being attached/detached. Use %t to represent the
# type of node being attached or detached: the letter m will be passed
# in for master nodes and the letter s for standby nodes.
#
# Example:
# script.load.balancer.attach=/somepath/attachscript %h %t
script.load.balancer.attach=/tmp/efm-scripts/load_balancer_attach.sh %h
script.load.balancer.detach=/tmp/efm-scripts/load_balancer_detach.sh %h

# Absolute path to fencing script run during promotion
#
# This is an optional user-supplied script that will be run during
# failover on the standby database node.  If left blank, no action will
# be taken.  If specified, EFM will execute this script before promoting
# the standby.
#
# Parameters can be passed into this script for the failed master and
# new primary node addresses. Use %p for new primary and %f for failed
# master. On a node that has just been promoted, %p should be the same
# as the node's efm binding address.
#
# Example:
# script.fence=/somepath/myscript %p %f
#
# NOTE: FAILOVER WILL NOT OCCUR IF THIS SCRIPT RETURNS A NON-ZERO EXIT CODE.
script.fence=

# Absolute path to fencing script run after promotion
#
# This is an optional user-supplied script that will be run after
# failover on the standby node after it has been promoted and
# is no longer in recovery. The exit code from this script has
# no effect on Failover Manager, but will be included in a notification
# sent after the script executes.
#
# Parameters can be passed into this script for the failed master and
# new primary node addresses. Use %p for new primary and %f for failed
# master. On a node that has just been promoted, %p should be the same
# as the node's efm binding address.
#
# Example:
# script.post.promotion=/somepath/myscript %f %p
script.post.promotion=/tmp/efm-scripts/post_promotion.sh %p %f

# Absolute path to resume script
#
# This script is run before an IDLE agent resumes
# monitoring its local database.
script.resumed=

# Absolute path to script run after database failure
#
# This is an optional user-supplied script that will be run after
# an agent detects that its local database has failed.

# Absolute path to script run on isolated master
#
# This is an optional user-supplied script that will be run after
# a master agent detects that it has been isolated from the majority
# of the efm cluster.
script.master.isolated=

# Absolute path to script invoked on non-promoting agent nodes
# before a promotion.
#
# This optional user-supplied script will be invoked on other agents
# when a node is about to promote its database. The exit code from this script has
# no effect on Failover Manager, but will be included in a notification
# sent after the script executes.
#
# Pass a parameter (%p) with the script to identify the new primary node address.
#
# Example:
# script.remote.pre.promotion=/path_name/script_name %p

# Absolute path to script invoked on non-master agent nodes
# after a promotion.
#
# This optional user-supplied script will be invoked on nodes
# (except the new master) after a promotion occurs. The exit code from this script has
# no effect on Failover Manager, but will be included in a notification
# sent after the script executes.
#
# Pass a parameter (%p) with the script to identify the new primary node address.
#
# Example:
# script.remote.post.promotion=/path_name/script_name %p
script.remote.post.promotion=

# Absolute path to a custom monitoring script.
#
# Use script.custom.monitor to specify the location and name of an optional
# user-supplied script that will be invoked periodically to perform custom
# monitoring tasks. A non-zero exit value means that a check has failed;
# this will be treated as a database failure.  On a master node, script
# failure will cause a promotion.  On a standby node script failure will
# generate a notification and the agent will become IDLE.
#
# The custom.monitor.* properties are required if a custom monitoring script
# is specified:
#
# custom.monitor.interval is the time in seconds between executions of the script.
#
# custom.monitor.timeout is a timeout value in seconds for how long the script
# will be allowed to run.  If script execution exceeds the specified time, the
# task will be stopped and a notification sent. Subsequent runs will continue.
#
# If custom.monitor.safe.mode is set to true, non-zero exit codes from the
# script will be reported but will not cause a promotion or be treated as a
# database failure. This allows testing of the script without affecting EFM.
